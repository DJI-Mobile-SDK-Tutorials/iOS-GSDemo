/**
 *  Mission Control handles execution of missions. Either single missions can be run
 *  through dedicated mission operators, or a series of missions and actions can be
 *  run serially using the Timeline.
 *   Mission operators look after execution of a single mission. A mission operator
 *  has APIs to control the mission (e.g. start, stop, pause etc.) and provides
 *  mission state through listeners.
 *   Mission Control's Timeline is made up of a series of Timeline elements which
 *  can be Waypoint missions,  Hotpoint missions (through the Hotpoint action
 *  `DJIHotpointAction`) or objects that follow the
 *  `DJIMissionControlTimelineElement` protocol. `DJIMissionAction` is a Timeline
 *  element, with  `DJIAircraftYawAction` and `DJIGimbalAttitudeAction` subclasses
 *  being examples of specific actions.  If a mission is being executed in a
 *  Timeline, the mission operator can still be used to get state  information of
 *  the mission as well as change mission execution parameters.
 *   Timeline elements can also have triggers (`DJIMissionTrigger`) associated with
 *  them. Triggers are separate objects that are run in parallel with a Timeline
 *  element. The trigger object is used to initiate actions if a set of criteria are
 *  met. For example, a trigger could be used to monitor battery level, and then
 *  initiate an action once a threshold is passed.
 *   The listening mechanism for Mission Control is block based. To listen to an
 *  event, a listener  object and a block to execute when the event occurs is passed
 *  to Mission Control. The listener object is only used by Mission Control to keep
 *  track of whether it should execute the listener block or not. Mission Control
 *  would not execute the listener block if the listener object was removed from the
 *  listener pool.
 *   Mission Control is accessed from `missionControl` in `DJISDKManager`.
