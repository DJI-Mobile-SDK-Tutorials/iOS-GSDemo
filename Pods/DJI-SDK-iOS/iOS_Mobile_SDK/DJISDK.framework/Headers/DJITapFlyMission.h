 *  obstacles when the scene is sufficiently illuminated (more than 300 lux but
 *  less than 10,000 lux). The aircraft will stop flying in the direction if it
 *  reaches its radius limitation, the mission is stopped, the user pulls back on
 *  the pitch stick or if it comes to an obstacle it cannot bypass. The Remote
 *  Controller yaw stick can be used to adjust the heading of the aircraft during
 *  mission execution, which also adjusts the direction of flight to the new yaw.
 *  Using any other stick controls will cancel the mission.
