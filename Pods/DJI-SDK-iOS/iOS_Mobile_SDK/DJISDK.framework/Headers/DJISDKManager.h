 *  product) to better  understand the root cause of a crash and determine whether
 *  the incident is covered under warranty. They can  also be used by developers to
 *  debug their application. SDK Logs record commands from the application to the
 *  SDK, and information from the SDK to the application that are related to flight.
 *  Logs are cached to the mobile  device, and will overwrite themselves to limit
 *  storage footprint. `archiveLogs` will move the logs to an archive  folder. Logs
 *  in the archive, will only be overwritten by newer archives that go beyond the
 *  storage limit and not  normal log generation. The storage limit for normal log
 *  generation is 400 MB (about 500 minutes of flight). The  storage limit for the
 *  archive is an additional 400 MB. The logs have an encrypted and unencrypted
 *  portion. The  unencrypted portion can be used by developers to see all commands
 *  and information sent to and received from the  SDK by the mobile application
 *  that is related to flight. The encrypted portion can only be used by a DJI
 *  service  facility as it includes proprietary hardware protocols and is used to
 *  tie the SDK logs and product flight logs  together. Logs can be transferred to
 *  the DJI service facility either by manually downloading from the mobile  device
 *  using iTunes, or the application can send archived logs to a DJI endpoint using
 *  `uploadArchivedLogs`.  Developers should be careful to upload logs directly when
