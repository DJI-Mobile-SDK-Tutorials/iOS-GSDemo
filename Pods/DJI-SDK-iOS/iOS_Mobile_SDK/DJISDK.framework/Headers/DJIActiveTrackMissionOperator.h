/**
 *  The active track mission operator is the only object that controls, runs and
 *  monitors ActiveTrack Missions. It can be accessed from `DJIMissionControl`.
 *   An ActiveTrack Mission allows an aircraft to track a moving subject using the
 *  vision system and without a GPS tracker on the subject. To use an ActiveTrack
 *  mission:
 *   - Prepare a mission with the rectangle that best represents the  target to
 *  track
 *   - Start the mission to initiate tracking of the object and  begin the state
 *  updates (DJIMissionProgressStatus)
 *   - At this point, the  aircraft will track the target while hovering in place.
 *   - Give confirmation that the tracked target is correct  with
 *  `acceptConfirmationWithCompletion` and the aircraft will begin flying  relative
 *  to the target.
 *   - If the tracking algorithm looses sufficient  confidence in tracking the
 *  target, then the aircraft will stop flying relative  to the object and either
 *  notify the user (through execution state) that the  target is lost or it needs
 *  another confirmation that the target is correct.
 *   - If the mission is paused, the aircraft will hover in place, but continue
 *  tracking the target by adjusting gimbal pitch and aircraft yaw.
 *   - If mission is resumed, confirmation of tracking rectangle will need to be
 *  sent through to  start flying relative to target.
 *   - The mission can be canceled with `stopMissionWithCompletion`  at any time.  -
 *  `stopMissionWithCompletion` should also be used to reject tracking confirmation
 *  if the camera is tracking the wrong target. After stopping the mission, the
 *  mission needs to be recreated with a new rectangle and loaded into the operator.
 *   - The main camera is used to track the target, so gimbal cannot be adjusted
 *  during an  ActiveTrack mission.
 *   - During the mission  the aircraft can be manually flown with pitch, roll and
 *  throttle. Yaw and gimbal are  automatically controlled to continue tracking the
 *  target.
 *   - If the mission is  executing, and after confirmation of the tracking
 *  rectangle has been sent, the  aircraft can be manually controlled horizontally
 *  similar to a  `DJIFlightOrientationModeHomeLock` where the home is the tracked
 *  target. If aircraft  is manually controlled upward, the aircraft will lift and
 *  retreat, and if it is  controlled downward, it will go down and get closer to
 *  the target.
