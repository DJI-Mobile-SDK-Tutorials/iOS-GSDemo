/**
 *  In the waypoint mission, the aircraft will travel between waypoints, execute
 *  actions at waypoints, and  adjust heading and altitude between waypoints.
 *  Waypoints are physical locations to which the aircraft  will fly. Creating a
 *  series of waypoints, in effect, will program a flight route for the aircraft to
 *  follow. Actions can also be added to waypoints, which will be carried out when
 *  the aircraft reaches the  waypoint. The aircraft travels between waypoints
 *  automatically at a base speed. However, the user can  change the speed by using
 *  the pitch joystick. If the stick is pushed up, the speed will increase. If  the
 *  stick is pushed down, the speed will slow down. The stick can be pushed down to
 *  stop the aircraft  and further pushed to start making the aircraft travel back
 *  along the path it came. When the aircraft  is traveling through waypoints in the
 *  reverse order, it will not execute waypoint actions at each  waypoint. If the
 *  stick is released, the aircraft will again travel through the waypoints in the
 *  original  order, and continue to execute waypoint actions (even if executed
 *  previously). If the aircraft is pulled  back along the waypoint mission all the
 *  way to the first waypoint, then it will hover in place until the  stick is
 *  released enough for it to again progress through the mission from start to
 *  finish. It is not  supported by Mavic Pro when using WiFi connection.
