/**
 *  Fly Zone Manager gives information about nearby fly zones, and APIs to unlock

 *  zones possible:
 *   - NFZ: Cylinder or truncated cone volume where flight is restricted
 *   - Poly: Fly zone that consists of one or more sub fly zones that are cylinders
 *  or complex volumes with different height limitations. A height limitation of 0
 *  means flight is completely restricted. This is used by Mavic, Phantom 4 Pro,
 *  Inspire 2 and Phantom 4
 *   - GEO: Cylinder volume with four levels of restriction:
 *      - Warning Zones - no restriction
 *      - Enhanced warning zones - Flight restricted, can be unlocked for
 *          flight when the user logs into their DJI account
 *      - Authorization zones - Flight restricted, can be unlocked for
 *          flight when the user logs into their DJI account and the account
 *          has been authorized to unlock authorization zones.
 *      - Restricted zones - Flight restricted
 *   On the Phantom 3, Inspire 1, M100, M600, A3/N3 series of products there can
 *  also be  a 4km buffer around an NFZ fly zone where flight height is limited to
 *  120m. If the  aircraft is in such a buffer area, `DJIFlyZoneState` will be
 *  `DJIFlyZoneStateInWarningZoneWithHeightLimitation`.
